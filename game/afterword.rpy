label afterword:

    pm "Thanks for spending the time to play/read through my game."
    pm "I tried to recreate everything as close as I could remember, but memory is always faulty. Especially during mundane moments."
    pm "Honestly, the days around Labor day when my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer I don't remember that well."
    pm "What's in the game right now is the closest approximation I could make."
    pm "I also apologize for putting words in people's mouths"
