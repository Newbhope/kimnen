My first game! A visual novel documenting my life from August 2016 to May 2017.

Original idea came about around end of December 2016 after watching this Extra Credits video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=569XsBCxkCE

I played the mentioned game from here: http://serenityforge.com/games/lovinglife

I collected images across the year, but didn't start earnest work on the script until end of spring and right before the October 19 release date.

Feel free to reference how I made the game. Be warned that the script files are messy from me trying out stuff.
