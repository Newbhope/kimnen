This... is a hard story to tell.
Every time I think of {b}her{/b}, emotions overwelm and debilitate me. At the same time, these emotions provide comfort and warmth that I've grown up with.

Hey guys wanna play a game of dota?
Sure
Hello?
Hi Johnny... It's not looking too good.
I mute my voice chat so my friends don't hear the call.
I mean yeah makes sense...
Should I... go home soon then?
Do you have to be at school though?
I don't have to. I mean like, I'm looking at my schedule right now. I go home this weekend at the least and stay home until like Tuesday.
While the call is going, I'm still playing dota with one hand.
Can you go home sooner instead? Maybe Friday?
Um yeah I think I'm free all day Friday. I should be able to.
The sooner you come back the better also.
Um... I'll check tomorrow... Now that I think about it I'll be able to come home tomorrow.
Don't you have to be at school though?
No cause tomorrow after 3 o clock I'll be free. I don't have to be on campus.
When is your interview tomorrow?
Uh 11 AM.
OK. I think it's best if you leave as soon as possible.
I'll try.
Bye Johhny.
OK, bye.
I take a deep breath after that call... I'm not too sure how to process it yet. I put my earbuds back on and go back to the game of dota as if nothing happened.
The game ends. I say bye to my friends and leave the voice call.
I guess I have to contact my professors and TAs about the situation...
